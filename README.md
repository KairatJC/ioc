# My attempt at understanding what is IoC, DIP, DI
I used this [resource](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/ioc/) for learning.

## First:
IoC (Inversion of Control) and DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) are **principles**    
DI (Dependency Injection) - **Pattern**   
IoC Container - **Framework**   

## Scope of work:   
**Problem:**     
**Goal:** Loosely Coupled Classes   
   
 - [*] Implement problem situation
 - [ ] Implement IoC using Factory Pattern
 - [ ] Implement DIP by creating abstraction
 - [ ] Implement DI
 - [ ] Use IoC Container
